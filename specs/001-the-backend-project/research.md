# Research & Analysis

## Summary

No specific research was required for this feature. The technical direction, including the choice of language (Python 3.12), framework (FastAPI), and core dependencies (OpenAI Agents SDK, Loguru), was clearly defined in the feature specification and aligns with the project's constitution. The implementation path is straightforward based on these established technology choices.
