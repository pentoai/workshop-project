# Feature Specification: Baseball Backend API with AI Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-backend-project`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The backend project is alread initialized in the `baseball_backend` folder. Have a FastAPI API with an endpoint called /query that will receive a baseball player full name. Then, we'll start streaming the results of an AI agent developed with the OpenAI Agents SDK framework @OpenAI-Agents. The agent need to have two main tools: searching inside a database and searching the web. The agent will retrieve information of the given baseball player from the database using a Supabase database MCP where you can get all the tables schemas as needed. The agent will analyze the schema and decide what tables it needs to get extractions and make queries about them. IMPORTANT: the Supabase database is already set up and ready to use, there's no need to create any tables, databases or other resources. You can get all the tables schemas as needed. The agent will search the web for the baseball player to get news, articles, and general information about the player. The agent should use the WebSearchTool to search the web. The endpoint should stream the agent's response, not wait for the agent to finish to get the final response. The prompts should be defined outside the python code and defined in .txt files in a "prompts" folder. The agents will load the prompts from the files and put any variables inside using python string formatting. The response format of the agent will be a Pydantic class which will contain all the important information of a baseball player including: history, simple information, statistics, games. There will be no authentication for now. If the endpoint fails, return a 500 http error - the client will handle it. No worries about rate limits. Use loguru for logging and tracking all requests and progress of the requests. Remember to add the python dependencies to the pyproject.toml file using uv add <package> or uv add -d <package> for development dependencies. Remember to use python 3.12 for the backend. You'll use the OpenAI Agents SDK MCPServerStdio class to communicate with the OpenAI MCP server with the Supabase database."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user of the frontend application, I want to query a baseball player by their full name and receive streaming information about them, including their history, simple information, statistics, and games, gathered from a database and the web by an AI agent, so I can get comprehensive and up-to-date details without delay.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the backend API is running, **When** a GET request is made to `/query` with a valid `player_full_name` parameter, **Then** the API should return a 200 OK status and start streaming the AI agent's response.
2. **Given** the AI agent is processing a query for a baseball player, **When** the agent retrieves information from the Supabase database, **Then** the streamed response should include relevant database extractions.
3. **Given** the AI agent is processing a query for a baseball player, **When** the agent searches the web for news and articles, **Then** the streamed response should include relevant web search results.
4. **Given** the AI agent completes its information gathering, **When** the agent constructs a Pydantic class response, **Then** the streamed response should conclude with a complete BaseballPlayerInfo object containing history, simple information, statistics, and games.
5. **Given** the backend API is running, **When** an internal error occurs during the AI agent's processing or API execution, **Then** the API should return a 500 HTTP error.
6. **Given** the backend API is running and a request is made to `/query`, **When** Loguru is configured, **Then** all requests and their progress should be logged.

### Edge Cases

- When a `player_full_name` is provided that does not exist, the agent will stream a message "No information found for [Player Name]." and conclude the stream.
- The agent will pass raw, unfiltered data from the web search tool directly into the stream.
- If the Supabase database connection fails, the agent will immediately propagate the error, resulting in a 500 HTTP response.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: When a `player_full_name` is provided that does not exist in the database or on the web, how should the agent respond? ‚Üí A: Stream a clear message stating "No information found for [Player Name]." and end the stream.
- Q: How should the system handle cases where the web search tool returns irrelevant or malformed data? ‚Üí A: The agent will pass the raw, unfiltered data through in the stream.
- Q: What is the expected behavior if the Supabase database connection fails or returns an error? ‚Üí A: The agent should immediately propagate the error, causing the endpoint to return a 500 error.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The backend MUST expose a `/query` endpoint via FastAPI.
- **FR-002**: The `/query` endpoint MUST accept a `player_full_name` as input.
- **FR-003**: The `/query` endpoint MUST stream the AI agent's response.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST integrate an AI agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK framework.
- **FR-005**: The AI agent MUST utilize a tool for searching a Supabase database.
- **FR-006**: The AI agent MUST utilize a WebSearchTool for searching the web.
- **FR-007**: The AI agent MUST load prompts from `.txt` files located in a "prompts" folder, supporting Python string formatting for variables.
- **FR-008**: The AI agent's final response MUST be formatted as a Pydantic class, `BaseballPlayerInfo`, containing `history`, `simple information`, `statistics`, and `games`.
- **FR-009**: The API MUST return a 500 HTTP error in case of internal failure.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST use Loguru for comprehensive logging of requests and progress.
- **FR-011**: The backend project MUST use Python 3.12.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST use the OpenAI Agents SDK `MCPServerStdio` class to communicate with the OpenAI MCP server with the Supabase database.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **BaseballPlayerInfo**: Represents the comprehensive information about a baseball player, structured with fields for history, simple information, statistics, and games. This is the output format of the AI agent.
